    | header row, a link with nothing in it, and a colour that cannot be read on the
    | page it is going to. Every finding is a row that selects what it is about.
    |
    | 'rules' is which of the six are asked; a name left out is not reported.
    |
    | Contrast is the one rule with two assumptions in it, and they are stated rather
    | than hidden: the editor cannot know what colour the page will be, nor what colour
    | it writes on that page where nobody chose one, because both belong to the front
    | end. 'background' and 'text' are those two - a chosen colour is measured against
    | the background, and a chosen background against the text colour, so highlighting a
    | sentence in dark blue is caught as well. 'threshold' is what the ratio has to reach - 4.5 is WCAG AA for ordinary text, and 'large_threshold'
    | is the easier level that headings and text of 24px and up are held to. Only the
    | light half of the palette is checked: a document rendered in both themes is two
    | questions, and answering one of them twice is a panel listing everything twice.
    |
    | 'weak_link_phrases' are added to the translated list rather than replacing it -
    | "click here" is a fact about English and not about the web, so the shipped list
    | follows the locale, and this is where a project adds the wording its own house
    | style keeps producing. A link's whole text has to be the phrase: "click here for
    | the report" says what it is and is left alone.
    |
    | Shipped off. It is a review tool rather than a way of writing, and the contrast
    | rule is measured against a page this package has to be told the colour of - on by
    | default, every project whose pages are not white would be handed findings that are
    | wrong. Switch it on here or per field with `->accessibility()`, and the button
    | appears where the shipped toolbar already reserves a place for it, between 'find'

    | Images

    | `float` puts the two side buttons on that strip, which let the text run past the

    | `->imageFloat()`.
    |
    | `float_gap` is the space written between the picture and the text beside it, as a
    | CSS length. It travels in the stored markup, because the page a document ends up on
    | has not loaded this package's stylesheet and a floated picture with no gap has the
    | text touching it. Set it to null to write the bare `float` and draw the gap in your
    | own stylesheet.
    |
    | `decorative` puts a switch on the image bar for a picture that carries nothing worth
    | describing — a divider, a texture, a flourish. It writes an empty `alt` together with
    | `role="presentation"`, and the pair is the point: an empty `alt` on its own is what a
    | checker has to report as a description somebody forgot.
    |
    | Off, because that sentence is the whole of what it buys, and the checker it buys it
    | from ships off as well. Switch it on beside `accessibility.enabled`, which is where it
    | pays; on a field without the check it is a button whose effect nobody ever sees. Note
    | that a field with this off does not know the attribute, so a picture marked elsewhere
    | loses the mark when that field saves — the same bargain every switch here makes.
    | Per field: `->imageDecorative()`.
    |
    | `link` lets a picture be given an address to point at, rendered as an `<a>` around it
    | — and around the picture inside a `<figure>` where there is a caption, since a caption
    | is text about the picture rather than part of what is being linked. Per field:

    | package's own resizing drags — so the measured size is also the displayed size. Pages
    | carrying the usual `img { max-width: 100%; height: auto }` gain the aspect ratio for
    | nothing. A page that caps the width and lets the height stand gets a squashed picture,
    | and should turn this off.
    |
    | `loading` is the hint written onto an inserted picture: 'lazy', 'eager' or null for
    | none. Null on purpose — a field cannot know where on a page its pictures land, and

    | Media library
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    | The image button opens a browser of the pictures that are already on the
    | server, with uploading as its second tab. Picking one stores what an upload
    | would have stored — a media UUID, or a storage path on a field without a media
    | collection — so one file can back any number of references and nothing is
    | copied. Size and rotation stay on the image node, never on the file.

    | Out of the box the browser is a shared library: it shows every picture in the
    | collection the field uploads to, whichever record or model owns it. That is what
    | the browser is for — a picture uploaded for one article is the picture the next
    | one wants — and it is the 'scope' setting below. Narrow it with
    | `'scope' => 'record'` where each record should only see its own.
    |
    | Sharing has one consequence worth knowing before you ship it: removing a picture
    | from a document no longer deletes the file. It cannot — the uuid may equally be
    | sitting in another record's content, which nothing here can see, so deleting it
    | would take that record's picture away too. A shared library is therefore tidied
    | deliberately, with `spatie/laravel-medialibrary`'s own cleanup commands or by
    | hand. `'scope' => 'record'` restores automatic clean-up, because then nothing
    | else can be holding the uuid.

    | Icons
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    | Every icon this package draws, in one place. A bare Heroicon name ('trash',
    | 'photo') is handed to Filament as its enum, which picks the variant matching the
    | size it is drawn at; anything with a set prefix is used verbatim ('heroicon-o-*',
    | Filament's 'fi-o-*', this package's 'arte-*', 'lucide-*', any Blade Icons set).
    |
    | Filament's own buttons — bold, italic, the headings — are not in this list. They
    | belong to Filament and are swapped through `FilamentIcon::register()`.

    | Anchors
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    | Headings that a link can point at, used by `AdvancedRichContentRenderer::
    | anchorHeadings()` and by `TableOfContents`. Both take their ids from the same pass,
    | so a link in the list and an `id` on the page cannot drift apart.
    |
    |   'levels'    which heading levels get an anchor, and appear in a table of contents
    |   'position'  where the heading's link to itself is drawn: 'none' (nothing is added,
    |               the default), 'before', 'after', or 'wrap' to turn the heading text
    |               itself into the link
    |   'symbol'    the marker drawn for 'before' and 'after'
    |   'class'     the class on that link and, with `-toc`, on the table of contents
    |   'language'  whose transliteration rules build the slug: null folds to plain ASCII
    |               ("Uber uns"), 'de' spells the umlaut out ("ueber-uns"). The anchor ends
    |               up in URLs, so this is a project-wide decision.
    |
    | An id already in the stored markup is kept as it is - something out there may link
    | to it - and counted, so nothing generated afterwards collides with it.

    |   'ttl'     how long a rendered document is kept, in seconds. null keeps it until
    |             something clears the store. Capped automatically where the markup holds
    |             temporary URLs, which expire sooner than any of this.
    |   'store'   which cache store to use. null is the application's default.
    |   'prefix'  what every key starts with, so a store can be swept by pattern.
    |
    | The key covers the content and the renderer's configuration — but not what a closure
    | closes over, and not what a mention provider will answer. Per render: `->cached()`,

    |
    |   'characters'  how long the text may be. The ellipsis is added on top of it, the

    |                 meta description before it stops.
    |   'end'         what marks the cut. Nothing is appended where the text already
    |                 ends in a full stop, so the two marks never meet.
