/*
 * The grip in the margin, and the plus beside it.
 *
 * Hovering a block puts two small controls in the gutter to its left: one to drag the block
 * somewhere else, one to start a new block under it. Together with the slash menu the field
 * already has, that is the whole of what people mean when they say an editor should feel
 * like Notion - a document you can take apart with the mouse rather than one you can only
 * type into.
 *
 * Almost none of the moving is done here. ProseMirror already knows how to drop a slice at
 * a position, which node a point is inside, and where the insertion line goes - Filament
 * registers its drop cursor - so what this adds is the part that has no home anywhere else:
 * something to take hold of. A drag begins by selecting the block and handing the selection
 * to `view.dragging`, and from there it is ProseMirror's drag, with ProseMirror's rules
 * about where a node may land. Reimplementing that would mean owning every question about
 * what can sit inside what, in a schema that a project can add nodes to.
 *
 * The handle hangs off the editor's own box rather than off the document, and it is
 * positioned rather than laid out: it sits in the field's left padding, which the
 * stylesheet widens for a field that has one. Widening it is not free and it is the honest
 * price - Filament's editor leaves twenty pixels there and two controls need fifty - but
 * the alternative is a handle that appears on top of the first word of every block it is
 * meant to be beside. The padding belongs to fields carrying the settings attribute and to
 * no others, so an editor without the grip is the editor Filament drew.
 *
 * Only the top level of the document gets one. A paragraph, a heading, a list, a table, an
 * image: one grip each, and the grip on a list takes the list. Grabbing a single item out
 * of a list is what people ask for next, and it is deliberately not here - a list item is a
 * node that may only live inside a list, so dropping one into a paragraph is a question
 * ProseMirror answers with "nowhere", and the honest version of that feature is a drag that
 * refuses more often than it works.

 * a handle centred on the block would sit halfway down a paragraph of nine lines, which
 * reads as belonging to the middle of the text rather than to the block. It is centred on
 * the first line instead, which is where the eye already is.
 *
 * The horizontal answer has a direction in it, which is the part that is easy to get
