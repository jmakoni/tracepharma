/*
 * What is wrong with this document, said while there is still somebody to say it to.
 *
 * Six questions, and they are the six that a person writing an article can answer and
 * nobody downstream can: a picture nobody described, a link whose text is "click here", a
 * heading level jumped over, a table with no header row, a link with nothing in it, and a
 * colour somebody chose that cannot be read on the page it is going to. None of them is
 * something a stylesheet or a renderer can put right later - they are all decisions, and
 * the moment to make them is the moment the content is being written.
 *
 * The check runs in the browser and not on the server, and that is the whole point rather
 * than a convenience. A report that arrives after saving is a list of things to go back and
 * find; a panel in the editor is a list of things to click on. Every finding carries the
 * position it was found at, so a row in the panel selects the picture, the link or the
 * heading it is about.
 *
 * The judging is separate from the looking, which is why any of this can be held to
 * account. `subjectsOf()` walks the document and writes down what it saw - a picture and
 * its alt text, a link and its text, a heading and its level - as plain data with positions
 * attached. `findingsFor()` reads that list and knows every rule; it has never seen a
 * document, and it does not need one to be wrong or right about a contrast ratio.
 *
 * Contrast is the rule with an assumption in it, and the assumption is stated rather than
 * hidden: the editor cannot know what colour the page will be, because that belongs to the
 * front end. It is checked against `accessibility.background`, white unless a project says
 * otherwise, and against the light half of the palette. A project rendering this content on
 * another colour says so there, and one that renders it twice - light and dark - is asking
 * a question this cannot answer for both at once.
